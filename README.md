PHP Sqlite Administration
=========================

After initial startup the necessary database will be created in the ./data subdirectory. 
This database only contains the history of 'raw' queries and a placeholder and extension
for the directory containing databases.

In addition it contains a small set of tables for temporary data management.

version : 0.1.0.1 - 2013.12.19

In order to get connected use 'admin' and 'asp' to get further after login.
