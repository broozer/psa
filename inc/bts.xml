	Php-sqlite-admin (I refer to it as PSA also) is an attempt to get an web-based
	view on your sqlite databases, written in PHP.<br><br>
	This information assumes you have already a good foundation in PHP and SQLite-based
	SQL syntax.

		Obviously you will need a webserver and PHP. All development is done with PHP 5.3. 
		You will need to have the PDO extension
	activated.<br><br>
	I try to test as much as possible with different browsers, but usually the code will
	be tested using either Firefox or Chrome. As of this writing [2012.12.14], I successfully 
	used Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and IE (8).<br><br>
	<p id="error">CAUTION : some (critical) operations rely on Javascript , most notably 
	dropping databases. Running this program without Javascript enabled, will take 
	immediate effect ie. drop your database without further notice ! </p>

	After you copied the files in the directory of your liking, the program will
	run a small setup script (runs in the background).<br><br>
	It will create a subdirectory 'data' and will create in this directory a 
	database called 'base.sqlite'. The database has two tables, one for storing the
	active directory and extension and another for storing queries executed.
	After the installation process, the homepage will be opened and the entered 
	values point to the directory	and extension just created.<br><br>

	<![CDATA[
	The homepage gives you two input fields:
	<ul>
		<li>
		Directory : you can enter here the path of the directory where you want 
		to scan for sqlite databases. I have the habit to store my databases
		in a directory which does not fall under the directory structure of the 
		webserver. Under linux and comparable you need to make sure that the
		directory and files have the appropriate rights, in order to be able to 
		work on them.<br><br>
		You can enter relative or absolute directories and PSA will check whether
		the directory exists. If it exists, it will use the 'extension' value to
		scan for all databases in the given directory.<br><br>
		On Windows both back- and forward slashes work.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
		Extension: I usually give my databases '.sqlite' as extension. PSA will
		assume automatically a trailing dot.<br><br>
		E.g. to find the databases with the extension '.sqlite' under directory
		/var/sqlitedb, you enter '/var/sqlitedb' in the 'directory' box and 
		'sqlite' (NO DOT!) in the 'extension' box.<br><br>
		</li>
	</ul>

	</para>

	After checking whether the directory exists, the values you enter here are stored 
	in the base.sqlite databases (see Installation)
	and will be filled in automatically the next time you restart PSA.

	The menu on top appears when you click 'Go' on the homepage and show you to possible 
	values : home (homepage) and databases. In addition, you will see the selected directory 
	and extension value.<br><br>
	PSA will scan for existing databases and list them. Clicking on the name of the database
	'opens' the database and will switch to the 'Tables' page. In addition you can create a
	new database, vacuum and drop existing ones. When you click on the 'drop' link,
	you will be asked for confirmation first (javascript based !! if you run your browser 
	with Javascript disabled, the database will be dropped without further notice ).

	Various options are possible on tables :
	<ul>
	<li>add table : create new table</li>
	<li>structure : look at the table structure, checks whether you have a primary key and shows
	the SQL creation information. In addition you can drop columns (unordinary for most sqlite
	administration systems)</li>
	<li>browse : browse the tables' records, creation, editing and deletion of records can be done
	from here</li>
	<li>dump : creates a dump of all records in the table in SQL format</li>
	<li>drop : drops a table after a confirmation (javascript based !! if you run your browser 
		with Javascript disabled, the table will be dropped without further notice ).</li>
	<li>csv : basic semicolon dump (needs improvement off course)</li>
	</ul>

	When clicking table structure, you will get the following :
	<ul>
	<li>structure for the selected table (primary keys are indicated wil PK in red).
	You can also drop columns here. If you drop the last existing column for a table, 
	the table will be dropped.</li>
	<li>the 'create' statement for the table</li>
	<li>a list of existing indexes and a button to create new indexes. Indexes can be created
	and dropped. Updates are not yet possible.</li>

	<name>Queries</name>
	<para><![CDATA[
	In this module you can enter query statements and have them executed. It 
	will take any query you will enter and execute it. When succesfull, it will
	return to this screen silently or give you a result set. <br>
	If the query is not succesfull, an SQLite error message will indicate what is
	wrong with your query.<br>
	The last ten queries entered are displayed and by clicking the query, it will
	be copied to the textarea so you can eventually alter it and run it again.<br>
	In the database maintained for psa you can find a  list of all executed queries.
	This information is stored in the 'base.sqlite' database.

	I started working on a Sqlite PHP interface back in 2006. At that moment
	only Sqlite2 type databases were supported. I still use this first version
	for a few databases that are sqlite2 based.<br><br>
	With the advent of Sqlite3 and the improved functionality (think ALTER TABLE etc)
	I restarted the project and hosted it on google code. Due to the usual time
	constraints, I never really fully implemented the basic functionality. Also,
	the setup at that time reflected my somewhat limited capabilities..<br><br>
	Along came the sqlite-manager plugin for Firefox. I immediately found out that
	this tool fullfilled all your needs when developing on a local machine.<br><br>
	Since my needs to be able to work on remote databases grew, I recently restarted
	with yet another project. By coincidence I found out that you can use git in
	combination with subversion as a VCS. Et voila, I restarted this project.<br><br>
